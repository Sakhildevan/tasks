External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc). CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.			</div>
